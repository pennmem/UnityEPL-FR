Change Experiment so that InputHandler is not on the same thread
Change so that everything does drop stuff into the manager thread
  Instead it should use manager to find the threads that it needs to actually access and call a do on those
Refactor things so that Do is called by default on all the functions of an EventLoop



Options
  1) Use Tasks and the DoGet function to impliment an async way to get values from other threads
    - When you get the result (say human input), you can use a Do on the original class (FRExperiment) to push the result from the task and resume the old execution...
      - How do you get the caller to then wait until the other one is done executing? 
      - This is honestly the same exact thing as unity co-routines
  2) Make them convert tasks to event-driven "loops" (if statement functions)
  3)
